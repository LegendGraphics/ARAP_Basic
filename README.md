ARAP_Basic
==========

This is a c++ implementation of as-rigid-as-possible surface modeling

Sorkine, Olga, and Marc Alexa. "As-rigid-as-possible surface modeling." Symposium on Geometry processing. Vol. 4. 2007.
 
The code has been reorganized for dll export. Lib user can ignore the UI and test files which are Arap.h, Arap.ui, arap.cpp and main.cpp.

GUI depends on Qt 4.8.1 and display handler depends on VTK 5.10.1 in those legacy codes. Both of them can be changed to any other framework.
