ARAP_Basic
==========

This is an implementation of As-Rigid-As-Possible. 
The code has been reorganized for dll export. Lib user can ignore the files which are Arap.h, Arap.ui, arap.cpp and main.cpp.
GUI depends on Qt 4.8.1 and display handler depends on VTK 5.10.1 in those legacy codes. Both of them can be changed to any other framework.
